## Building the project

### Configuring TypeScript compilation

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es5",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "outDir": "dist",
    "sourceMap": true
  },

  "include": ["src/**/*.ts"],
  "exclude": ["src/**/*.spec.ts", "test", "node_modules"]
}
```

### Running the build

All the different build steps are orchestrated via [npm scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts).
Npm scripts basically allow us to call (and chain) terminal commands via npm.

| Npm Script   | Description                                                                     |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `start`      | Runs full build in developement and runs node on dist/index.js. Can be invoked with `npm start` |
| `build`      | Full build. Runs ALL build.                                                     |
| `test`       | Runs build and run tests using mocha                                            |
| `lint`       | Runs Eslint on project files                                                    |


## Testing

The tests are written inÂ Jest

```
"jest": "~27.3.1",
"ts-jest": "^27.0.5",
"supertest": "6.1.6",
```

### Running tests using NPM Scripts

```
npm run test
```

Test files are created under __test__ folder.

## ESlint rules

All rules are configured through `eslintrc.json`.

## Running Eslint

```
npm run lint
```
